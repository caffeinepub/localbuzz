  "summary": "The diff shows new search-related state (`searchQuery`), an input ref, and imports for `Input` and an `X` icon in `CustomerHomeFeedPage.tsx`, but the JSX/render logic is truncated, so the required input field, filtering behavior, clear control, and empty-state messaging cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Replace the non-editable \"Search shops...\" control on the Customer Home Feed page with a real text input that accepts typing and focus, with accessible label and placeholder, while keeping layout (search left, filter button right).",
      "reason": "Although `Input` is imported and `searchQuery` state exists, the diff excerpt does not include the JSX showing an actual rendered <input> with placeholder \"Search shops...\" and an accessible label, nor does it show the layout with the filter button.",

      "requirement": "Implement client-side filtering of rendered feed items based on entered search text (case-insensitive), restoring full list when cleared, and show an English empty state when no matches.",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt does not show any code that filters `feedItems` based on `searchQuery`, nor any rendered empty-state message when there are zero matches.",

      "requirement": "Add an in-field clear control (X button) that appears only when query is non-empty, clears the query, keeps focus in the input, and is keyboard accessible with an accessible label.",
      "reason": "An `X` icon is imported and an input ref exists, but the diff excerpt does not show a rendered clear control, its conditional visibility, click/keyboard handlers, focus retention behavior, or accessible labeling (e.g., aria-label=\"Clear search\").",
